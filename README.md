# About the ECPHP project

The "ECPHP" project's purpose is to provide a set of reusable components that make the [PHP language](https://www.php.net/) and related technologies within the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/) easier to install, use and develop with.

According to [Commission Decision C(2019) 8672 of 25.11.2019](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/index.cfm?fuseaction=list&n=10&adv=0&coteId=3&year=2019&number=8672&version=F&serviceId=10165), these components should be distributed as Open Source Software (OSS) under the [BSD 3-clause licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

The main objective of licensing the software publicly is to achieve wide distribution and to allow the public to further develop and extend the software functionalities.
